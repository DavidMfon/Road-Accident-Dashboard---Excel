# Road-Accident-Dashboard 🚦

### Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a dynamic and interactive Road Accident Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, designed to provide meaningful insights into road accident casualties for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard enables stakeholders to analyze accident trends, casualty distribution, and risk factors to support informed decision making, policy formulation, and road safety improvements.

### Tools 🛠️

- Microsoft Excel

  - Pivot Tables

  - Pivot Charts

  - Slicers

  - KPI Cards

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparation 🧹
 
The dataset was cleaned and prepared via removal of inconsistencies and duplicate records creation of derived and calculated fields to support analysis. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 📊

- Overall casualty distribution

- Accident severity patterns

- Trends across vehicle types, road types, and surface conditions

- Temporal trends across months and years

- Day versus night accident patterns

*Pivot tables were used extensively to summarize and explore the dataset before visualization.*

### Results/Findings :🔍

Total casualties and their percentage distribution vary significantly by accident severity. Certain vehicle types contribute disproportionately to casualty figures. Casualties show clear monthly trends with noticeable year on year variations. Road type and surface condition have a strong influence on casualty distribution. Accidents occurring at night in certain locations show higher severity patterns. All findings are presented through fully interactive visualizations within the dashboard.

### Recommendations 💡

To reduce casualties, target high-risk vehicles with stricter safety regulations, improve high-casualty areas, enhance nighttime safety, and leverage trend insights for proactive prevention, integrating dashboard insights into policy and planning.
